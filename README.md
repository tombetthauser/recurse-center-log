# Secret Recurse Diary

Logging experience in the Fall2 batch at Recurse Center. Week by week as the sands of time collect in the garbage disposal of the mind.

---

## Week 1

### Accomplishments:
  - got a super basic home server working for the first time! ðŸ¤¯
  - met the goal of going to a lot and meeting to a lot of great people

### Blockers:
  - got past minor blockers with port forwarding and static ip setup (mostly isp's fault)
  - couldn't get some more creative (incorrect) uses of express to work

### Interactions:
  - great interactions across the boar
  - surprised to have really positive / productive interactions with other teachers
  - got a starting point for tapping into the weird art / zine alumni community at recurse

### Feelings 
  - :::)))
  
### Takeaways:
  - RC community exceeds all expectations
  - shocked at how positive it feels here
  - working on random inspiration projects is more satisfying than I was expecting
  - creative coding is codename for minihackathon and its amazing

### Plans and changes for next week:
  - leetcode ðŸ˜­
  - brainstorm directions for more small projects and a bigger project potentially
  - exercise maybe?

### What do you want to discuss with the group? 
(eureka moments, tips that worked really well for you, things you want to find a collaborator for, things you need help with, etc.)
  - building a publicly accessible home server is easier than building a herokuapp (??)

### Bonus Question: 
What are some things I'd like to work on during my batch that I haven't gotten around to planning yet?
  - a big weird esoteric art / code project (?)
  - some kind of practical platform for visual art hippies / art students (??)
  - start a zine / art weirdo group maybe
