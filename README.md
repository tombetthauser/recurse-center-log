# Recurse Log 🦑

Personal log of my experience at [Recurse Center](https://recurse.com).

---
<details>
  <summary>Week 1</summary>

## Week 1: Plans
- go to as much stuff as possible
- do a small / fun warm-up project

## Week 1: Reflections

### Accomplishments:
  - got a super basic home server working for the first time! 🤯
  - met the goal of going to a lot and meeting to a lot of great people

### Blockers:
  - got past minor blockers with port forwarding and static ip setup (mostly isp's fault)
  - couldn't get some more creative (incorrect) uses of express to work

### Interactions:
  - great interactions across the boar
  - surprised to have really positive / productive interactions with other teachers
  - got a starting point for tapping into the weird art / zine alumni community at recurse

### Feelings 
  - :::)))
  
### Takeaways:
  - RC community exceeds all expectations
  - shocked at how positive it feels here
  - working on random inspiration projects is more satisfying than I was expecting
  - creative coding is codename for minihackathon and its amazing

### Plans and changes for next week:
  - daily leetcode 😭
  - daily brainstorms (idea + why)
  - daily exercise group
  - zinebot
  - gallerybot

### What do you want to discuss with the group? 
(eureka moments, tips that worked really well for you, things you want to find a collaborator for, things you need help with, etc.)
  - building a publicly accessible home server is easier than building a herokuapp (??)

### Bonus Question: 
What are some things I'd like to work on during my batch that I haven't gotten around to planning yet?
  - a big weird esoteric art / code project (?)
  - some kind of practical platform for visual art hippies / art students (??)
  - start a zine / art weirdo group maybe

## Week 2: Plans
  - leetcode group ❌
  - exercise group ✅
  - daily brainstorm ☑️
  - zinebot ✅
  - gallerybot ❌

## Week 2: Reflections

### Accomplishments:
  - got a couple of good workouts in with the morning exercise group
  - got zinebot rebuilt, cleaned up and working
  - had an excellent pairing session working on zinebot
  - hosted first two meetings and they seemed to go really well
  - had productive project brainstorm

### Blockers:
  - having a cold was the only major hinderance
  - butting up against same speed issues with imagemagick
  - child care schedule still an issue (changes next week)

### Interactions:
  - great pairing session on zinebot
  - great zine / stickers group meeting

### Feelings 
  - tired / like I didn't get enough work done
  
### Takeaways:
  - got some great exposure to working in google colab and image manipuation using python
  - got over a nasty cold that derailed me for 2-3 days
  - got confirmation that image magick isn't a crazy tool to be using
  - got pointed towards client-side web-assembly version of imagemagick

### Plans and changes for next week:
  - 1-2 daily leetcodes
  - add 2-3 layouts to zinebot
  - basic gallerybot build / install
  - make budget / plan for solar server
  - get new homepage on server

### What do you want to discuss with the group? 
(eureka moments, tips that worked really well for you, things you want to find a collaborator for, things you need help with, etc.)
  - maybe get advice on gallerybot after basic build
  - get feedback on zinebot after 2-3 layouts done

### Bonus Question: 
What are some things I'd like to work on during my batch that I haven't gotten around to planning yet?
  - some kind of practical platform for visual art hippies / art students (??)
  - leetcode

  <summary>Week 6</summary>
  
  ## Plans
  * fully dive in to fast.ai and rust with michael
  
  ## Reflections
  * felt like progress was a bit slow
  * blocked by rust syntax and environment / setup issues with notebooks
  
  ## Accomplishments:
  * felt like  I got off the ground with Rust
  * feel comfortable with Rust book / docs / basic concepts
  * feel like I can continue to learn rust independently after batch
  * felt like I got off the ground with using notebooks / gpu services
  * felt like I got some ownership over fast.ai
  * feel like I could continue working through it independently after batch
  * finally settled on interface for home server and shared link with some people
  * got some really interesting / inspiring prints sent to my printer
  * feeling really proud of that project
  * had great conversations on post-batch art show
  * got the ball rolling to talk over next steps with sonali
  
  ## Blockers:
  * hitting basic syntax walls with rust
  * feels like I need (and want) to go back and study rust fundamentals
  * hitting walls with environment set-up in notebooks / gpu service environments
  * not sure where to start in getting more experienced with those
  
  ## Interactions:
  * a lot of really inspiring conversations and pairing time with michael nagle
  * got out to another in-person meet up in SF with old bootcamp / employer community
  * got to talk more and think more about career path after batch
  * missed going to checkins a bit but felt like a good different side of the RC experience 
  
  ## Feelings:
  * feeling really positive / fulfilled with RC experience
  * feeling like I want to have some tangible output
