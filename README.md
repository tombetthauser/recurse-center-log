# Secret Recurse Diary

Personal log of my experience at [Recurse Center](https://recurse.com).

---

## Week 1: Plans
  - go to as much stuff as possible
  - do a small / fun warm-up project


## Week 1: Reflections

### Accomplishments:
  - got a super basic home server working for the first time! ðŸ¤¯
  - met the goal of going to a lot and meeting to a lot of great people

### Blockers:
  - got past minor blockers with port forwarding and static ip setup (mostly isp's fault)
  - couldn't get some more creative (incorrect) uses of express to work

### Interactions:
  - great interactions across the boar
  - surprised to have really positive / productive interactions with other teachers
  - got a starting point for tapping into the weird art / zine alumni community at recurse

### Feelings 
  - :::)))
  
### Takeaways:
  - RC community exceeds all expectations
  - shocked at how positive it feels here
  - working on random inspiration projects is more satisfying than I was expecting
  - creative coding is codename for minihackathon and its amazing

### Plans and changes for next week:
  - daily leetcode ðŸ˜­
  - daily brainstorms (idea + why)
  - daily exercise group
  - zinebot
  - gallerybot

### What do you want to discuss with the group? 
(eureka moments, tips that worked really well for you, things you want to find a collaborator for, things you need help with, etc.)
  - building a publicly accessible home server is easier than building a herokuapp (??)

### Bonus Question: 
What are some things I'd like to work on during my batch that I haven't gotten around to planning yet?
  - a big weird esoteric art / code project (?)
  - some kind of practical platform for visual art hippies / art students (??)
  - start a zine / art weirdo group maybe

## Week 2: Plan
  - leetcode group
  - exercise group
  - daily brainstorm
  - zinebot
